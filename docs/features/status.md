# /status Command

Send `/status` in any Discord channel or Telegram chat to get an instant system dashboard. This is a bot-level command — it responds immediately without spinning up an agent container.

## What It Shows

| Section | Description |

## How It Works

Unlike agent commands that route through the container pipeline, `/status` is handled directly by the bot at the channel adapter level — the same way `/ping` and `/chatid` work. This means:

- **Instant response** — no container spin-up, no agent processing
- **Works when things are broken** — if containers are stuck or the agent is down, `/status` still responds
- **No registration required** — works in any channel where the bot is present (Discord) or any chat (Telegram)

## Other Bot Commands

| Command | Platform | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/status` | Discord, Telegram | System dashboard |
| `/ping` | Telegram | Quick online check |
| `/chatid` | Telegram | Get the chat ID for registration |
