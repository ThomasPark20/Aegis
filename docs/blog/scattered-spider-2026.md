# Scattered Spider — Recent Campaigns & Evolving TTPs (2025–2026)

**Date:** 2026-04-07
**Severity:** Critical
**TLP:** CLEAR
**Aliases:** UNC3944, Scatter Swine, Oktapus, Octo Tempest, Storm-0875, Muddled Libra, 0ktapus, Starfraud

---

## Executive Summary

Scattered Spider remains one of the most active and dangerous cybercriminal collectives operating in 2025–2026. Since the high-profile MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment breaches in late 2023, the group has significantly evolved its tactics, expanding from hospitality and telecommunications into retail, aviation, financial services, and technology sectors. Key developments include a pivot to DragonForce Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), escalated Attacker-in-the-Middle (AiTM) phishing operations using Evilginx, deployment of an updated Spectre RAT with enhanced C2 capabilities, and increasingly sophisticated social engineering that targets third-party IT help desks. Despite multiple law enforcement operations resulting in arrests across the US and UK, the group's decentralized structure has allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption.

The April–May 2025 UK retail attacks (Marks & Spencer, Co-op, Harrods) caused an estimated £300M+ in damages, followed by a June–July 2025 wave targeting airlines (Hawaiian Airlines, WestJet, Qantas). A July 29, 2025 joint CISA/FBI advisory updated TTPs with new indicators including DragonForce deployment, AnyDesk/Teleport abuse, and RattyRAT usage. International law enforcement arrested multiple members in 2025, but the threat persists.

---

## Threat Actor Profile

### Structure & Organization
Scattered Spider is a loosely organized, English-speaking cybercriminal collective primarily composed of young adults (ages 17–22) from the US and UK. The group operates with a decentralized structure, recruiting members through online communities (Telegram, Discord). Members specialize in social engineering, with some actors hired specifically for vishing operations at compensation rates of $10,000–$25,000/month plus performance bonuses.

### Motivation
Financial gain through data extortion, ransomware deployment, and cryptocurrency theft. The group has stolen an estimated $11M+ in cryptocurrency and caused hundreds of millions in damages through ransomware operations.

### Ransomware Affiliations
- **ALPHV/BlackCat** (2023): Used in MGM/Caesars attacks
- **RansomHub** (2024): Affiliate operations
- **Qilin** (2024): Secondary ransomware deployment
- **DragonForce** (2025–present): Current primary RaaS platform; 80/20 revenue split with DragonForce operators

---

## Campaign Timeline (2025–2026)

### Q1 2025 — Phishing Infrastructure Overhaul
- Shifted from hyphenated domains (`sso-company[.]com`) to subdomain-based keywords (`sso[.]c0mpany[.]com`) to evade domain monitoring
- Deployed new phishing kit (#5) with dynamic subdomain usage and multi-brand templates
- Began using Cloudflare (AS13335) for hosting alongside existing Njalla (AS39287) and Virtuo (AS399486)
- Registered domains targeting Klaviyo, HubSpot, Pure Storage, Morningstar, Instacart, Vodafone

### Q2 2025 — UK Retail Attacks (April–May)
- **Marks & Spencer** (April 2025): Attackers gained initial access as early as February 2025 by impersonating an M&S employee and calling the third-party service desk to obtain a password reset. Exfiltrated the NTDS.dit file from the Windows domain controller. Deployed DragonForce ransomware, halting warehouse operations for 46 days. Estimated £300M in lost profit; ~£1B stock valuation impact.
- **Co-op Group** (May 2025): Attempted breach via similar social engineering; VPN access suspended as containment measure.
- **Harrods** (May 2025): Intrusion contained; stores remained operational.
- **Additional targets**: Dior, The North Face, Cartier, Victoria's Secret, Adidas at "unprecedented rate"

### Q2–Q3 2025 — Aviation Sector Targeting (June–July)
- **Hawaiian Airlines** (June 26, 2025): Cybersecurity event impacting IT systems
- **WestJet** (June 13, 2025): Incident affecting internal systems and the WestJet app
- **Qantas** (June 30, 2025): Unusual activity on third-party contact centre platform; customer data exposed (names, emails, phone numbers, birth dates, Frequent Flyer numbers)
- FBI issued formal warning on June 30 about Scattered Spider targeting the airline industry

### July 2025 — CISA/FBI Joint Advisory Update
- Updated advisory AA23-320A published July 29, 2025
- Added new TTPs: DragonForce ransomware, AnyDesk, Teleport.sh tunneling, RattyRAT, fake identity backstopping
- Co-authored by Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Australian Cyber Security Centre, and UK NCSC

### Q3 2025–Q1 2026 — Continued Operations
- Expanded targeting of SaaS platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday)
- Increased insider recruitment attempts
- Continued high-volume AiTM phishing campaigns with automated spear-phishing tools

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

### Initial Access

#### Social Engineering — Help Desk Exploitation (T1566.004, T1656)
The group's signature technique. Attackers impersonate employees or executives, calling IT help desks to request password resets or MFA device registration. They prepare by gathering employee information from LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and breached databases. Callers are native English speakers with minimal accents, sometimes using regional dialects (e.g., Southern US). The M&S breach specifically used this vector against a third-party managed service desk.

#### AiTM Phishing with Evilginx (T1566, T1557)
Significantly escalated in 2025. Evilginx-based phishing pages capture both credentials and session tokens, bypassing MFA entirely. Notable behaviors:
- **Rickroll redirects**: Evilginx configuration redirects security researchers to "Never Gonna Give You Up" YouTube video
- **Pre-populated victim information** in phishing links
- **One-time magic links** preventing security team analysis
- **Conditional content loading** — login page only renders for specific usernames
- **Malvertising distribution** via Google Ads to bypass email/network controls

#### SMS Phishing / Smishing (T1660)
High-volume campaigns using automated tools, some abusing Google Voice for identity harvesting at scale.

#### SIM Swapping (T1451)
Transferring victim phone numbers to attacker-controlled SIMs to intercept OTPs and MFA codes.

#### Trusted Relationship Exploitation (T1199)
Compromising MSPs and IT contractors (e.g., Tata Consultancy Services in the M&S attack) as a "one-to-many" access vector.

### Execution & Persistence

#### Remote Monitoring & Management Tools (T1219)
Deploys multiple RMM tools for persistent access:
- AnyDesk (newly added in 2025)
- ScreenConnect / ConnectWise
- Fleetdeck.io
- Level.io
- Pulseway
- Splashtop
- Tactical.RMM
- TeamViewer

#### Tunneling for C2 (T1090, T1572)
- **Ngrok**: Internet tunneling, often tunneling RDP (port 3389)
- **Teleport.sh**: Custom hostname masking (e.g., `CUSTOMERNAME.teleport[.]sh`)
- **Tailscale**: VPN mesh tunneling

#### Identity Federation Abuse (T1484.002)
Adding federated identity providers to victim SSO infrastructure for persistent, unrestricted tenant access.

#### MFA Token Registration (T1556.006)
Registering attacker-controlled MFA devices after obtaining password reset via help desk social engineering.

### Credential Access

#### NTDS.dit Extraction (T1003.003)
Exfiltrating Active Directory database for offline credential harvesting — confirmed in the M&S attack.

#### LSASS Memory Dumping (T1003.001)
Using Mimikatz for credential extraction from memory.

#### MFA Fatigue / Push Bombing (T1621)
Sending repeated MFA notification prompts until victim accepts.

#### Session Cookie Theft (T1539)
Evilginx captures session tokens that bypass MFA entirely.

### Lateral Movement & Discovery

#### Cloud Instance Abuse (T1578.002, T1021.007)
Creating new EC2 instances or accessing pre-existing cloud VMs for lateral movement.

#### Active Directory Enumeration (T1482, T1018)
Using AdFind for domain trust discovery and network mapping. Targeting VMware vCenter, backup infrastructure, and VPN concentrators.

#### DRSGetNCChanges / DCSync
Directory replication requests to extract credentials from domain controllers.

### Exfiltration

#### Multi-Channel Exfiltration (T1567, T1567.002)
- MEGA[.]NZ cloud storage
- Amazon S3 buckets
- Dropbox, FiveTran SaaS connectors
- SSH transfers to Vultr infrastructure
- Snowflake Data Cloud queries via ETL tools

### Impact

#### DragonForce Ransomware (T1486)
Current ransomware of choice. Built from leaked LockBit 3.0 and Conti source code. Targets Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi systems. Uses RSA + AES / ChaCha8 encryption. Pre-encryption behavior includes shadow copy deletion, event log clearing, backup destruction, and service stopping.

## Defensive Recommendations

### Immediate Priority
1. **Deploy phishing-resistant MFA** — FIDO2/WebAuthn or PKI-based; eliminates push bombing, SIM swap, and AiTM attacks
2. **Harden help desk identity verification** — Implement callback verification, video confirmation, or manager-approved identity checks before password resets or MFA changes
3. **Audit and allowlist RMM tools** — Block all unauthorized remote access software; alert on any RMM execution not in the approved list
4. **Monitor for NTDS.dit access** — Deploy Sigma rule #4; any access to NTDS.dit outside scheduled AD backups is critical
5. **Protect domain controllers** — Enable LSASS protection, credential guard, and DCSync detection

### Network & Infrastructure
6. **Block tunneling services** — Egress filter for ngrok[.]io, teleport[.]sh, tailscale domains; deploy Sigma rule #3
7. **Segment networks** — Isolate backup infrastructure, domain controllers, and VMware management from general user networks
8. **Monitor cloud infrastructure** — Alert on new EC2 instances, cloud storage access from unusual sources, and federation configuration changes
9. **Implement immutable backups** — Offline, air-gapped, regularly tested backup copies

### Identity & Access
10. **Restrict third-party access** — Harden MSP/contractor access with dedicated jumpboxes, mandatory MFA, and limited session duration
11. **Monitor Okta/Entra ID logs** — Deploy Sigma rules #1 and #6; alert on MFA factor changes, federation modifications, and bulk password resets
12. **Implement conditional access** — Risk-based authentication with impossible travel detection, device compliance, and anomalous login alerting

### Employee Training
13. **Vishing awareness** — Train help desk staff on social engineering pretexts; simulate attacks
14. **OTP/MFA code sharing** — Strict policy against sharing authentication codes under any circumstances
15. **Report suspicious calls** — Clear escalation path for help desk personnel when receiving unusual reset requests
