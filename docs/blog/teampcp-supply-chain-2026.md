# TeamPCP Supply Chain Campaign (March 2026)

**Date:** 2026-04-07
**TLP:** CLEAR
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-07

---

## Executive Summary

TeamPCP (aliases: PCPcat, Persy\_PCP, ShellForce, CipherForce, DeadCatx3) executed one of the most significant open-source supply chain attack campaigns in history during March 2026. Beginning with the compromise of Aqua Security's Trivy vulnerability scanner on March 19, the group cascaded access through Checkmarx KICS, BerriAI LiteLLM, the Telnyx Python SDK, and 47+ npm packages — weaponizing the very security tools organizations rely on. The campaign harvested cloud credentials, CI/CD secrets, and Kubernetes tokens from an estimated 500,000+ machines. CERT-EU attributed the breach of the European Commission's AWS infrastructure (92 GB exfiltrated) to TeamPCP with high confidence. The group partnered with Vect ransomware-as-a-service for monetization and deployed a self-replicating worm (CanisterWorm) with destructive wiper capabilities. CVE-2026-33634 (CVSS 9.4 Critical) was assigned and added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog with a remediation deadline of April 8, 2026.

## Threat Actor Profile

- **Name:** TeamPCP
- **Aliases:** PCPcat, Persy\_PCP, ShellForce, CipherForce, DeadCatx3
- **Telegram:** @Persy\_PCP, @teampcp
- **Motivation:** Financial (credential theft, ransomware, cryptomining, extortion)
- **Sophistication:** Advanced — multi-stage payloads, WAV steganography, ICP-hosted C2, cascading supply chain compromise
- **Partnerships:** Vect ransomware group (RaaS), announced via BreachForums; CipherForce (breach data publication)
- **OPSEC:** Low — uses identifiable open-source tools (TruffleHog, Nord Stream), obvious resource names ("pawn", "massive-exfil"), prioritizes speed over stealth

## Attack Chain

### Phase 1 — Initial Access (Trivy)
TeamPCP exploited incomplete credential rotation from a minor February breach to retain the `aqua-bot` service account PAT. They force-pushed 76 of 77 version tags in `aquasecurity/trivy-action` and all 7 tags in `aquasecurity/setup-trivy` to credential-stealing commits. A malicious Trivy binary (v0.69.4) was published via spoofed commits impersonating users `rauchg` and `DmitriyLewen`.

### Phase 2 — Cascading Compromise (KICS, LiteLLM)
Credentials harvested from Trivy CI/CD runners were used to compromise Checkmarx KICS GitHub Actions and the personal GitHub account of LiteLLM CEO Krish Dholakia. Malicious LiteLLM packages (v1.82.7, v1.82.8) were pushed to PyPI containing a three-stage payload: orchestrator (.pth file), credential collector, and persistence backdoor.

### Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion (Telnyx, npm)
PyPI credentials stolen from prior compromises enabled the Telnyx Python SDK compromise. A new TTP was introduced: WAV audio file steganography for payload delivery, with platform-specific payloads (Windows: `msbuild.exe` dropper; Linux/macOS: credential harvester). 47+ additional npm packages were poisoned via harvested publishing tokens.

### Phase 4 — Post-Compromise & Monetization
Stolen credentials were validated at scale using TruffleHog. AWS environments were systematically enumerated and exfiltrated (S3, Secrets Manager, RDS, ECS). The CanisterWorm worm component enabled self-replication through Docker API scanning, SSH key harvesting, and Kubernetes DaemonSet deployment. Partnership with Vect RaaS provided ransomware and extortion capability. 16+ victim organizations were publicly leaked; AstraZeneca was named as a victim (unconfirmed).

## Malware Analysis

### TeamPCP Cloud Stealer — Three Versions

**Version 1 — Monolithic Bash (150 lines)**
- Environment fingerprinting
- AWS/GCP/Azure IMDS credential harvesting
- Memory scraping via `/proc/<pid>/mem` to bypass GitHub secret masking (searches for `{"value":"<secret>","isSecret":true}`)
- Filesystem sweep of 50+ credential paths (~/.ssh/id\_rsa, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.kube/config, .env files)
- AES-256-CBC encryption with RSA-4096 key wrapping
- Exfiltration to C2 as `tpcp.tar.gz`
- Fallback: create `tpcp-docs` repository in victim's GitHub account

**Version 2 — Modular Loader (15-line pull-based)**
- Downloads `kube.py` payload from C2
- Self-deletion (`rm "$0"`)
- Remote payload updates without re-poisoning packages

**Version 3 — CanisterWorm (Worm & Wiper)**
- Self-replication via Docker API scanning (port 2375)
- SSH key harvesting for lateral movement
- Kubernetes cluster targeting via DaemonSet deployment
- Destructive wiper payload (deployed March 23, targeting Iran)
- C2 via Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canister — decentralized, tamper-proof
- Masquerades as systemd services (`sysmon.service`) and PostgreSQL utilities (`pgmon`, `pglog`)

### LiteLLM Payload — Three-Stage Architecture

| Stage | File | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| Orchestrator | `litellm_init.pth` (34 KB) | CPython .pth auto-execution; 50-minute C2 polling; YouTube link anti-sandbox check |
| Collector | `proxy_server.py` | Targets 50+ credential file paths; IMDS theft; K8s service account token extraction |
| Persistence | `sysmon.py` at `~/.config/systemd/user/sysmon.py` | Systemd user service; polls ICP-hosted C2; downloads payloads to `/tmp/pglog` |

### Telnyx Payload — WAV Steganography

Payloads embedded in `.wav` files that blend with Telnyx's voice/telecom API purpose:
- **Windows:** `hangup.wav` → XOR-decrypted `msbuild.exe` dropped to Startup folder
- **Linux/macOS:** `ringtone.wav` → AES-256-CBC + RSA-4096 credential sweeper matching LiteLLM pattern
- Same RSA-4096 public key and `tpcp.tar.gz` exfiltration pattern across all variants (strongest attribution link)

### Obfuscation Techniques
- LiteLLM v1.82.7: Base64 + zlib, RC4-encrypted strings
- LiteLLM v1.82.8: Evolved RC4 obfuscation
- Telnyx: WAV steganography with platform-specific XOR/AES decryption
- Double Base64 encoding in earlier payloads

## Detection Rules

The following detection rules target TeamPCP's core TTPs: supply chain payload execution, credential harvesting from CI/CD runners and cloud metadata services, persistence via .pth files and systemd services, WAV steganography payload delivery, and C2 communication. Rules cover process execution logs, file system events, network traffic, and file-level indicators. Log sources include Sysmon (Linux/Windows), cloud audit logs, DNS logs, and network flow data. All Sigma rules validated with `sigma check` (exit 0). All YARA rules validated with `yarac` (exit 0). Snort/Suricata rules are syntactically correct but Snort was not available for runtime validation.

## Remediation Guidance

### Immediate Actions
1. **Audit CI/CD pipelines** for any use of compromised package versions (Trivy v0.69.4–v0.69.6, LiteLLM v1.82.7–v1.82.8, Telnyx v4.87.1–v4.87.2, KICS compromised tags)
2. **Rotate ALL credentials** that may have been exposed: GitHub PATs, AWS keys, SSH keys, K8s service account tokens, PyPI tokens, .env file contents
3. **Search for fallback repositories** named `tpcp-docs` or `docs-tpcp` in all organizational GitHub accounts
4. **Scan for persistence artifacts:** `~/.config/systemd/user/sysmon.py`, `sysmon.service`, `/tmp/pglog`, `.pg_state`
5. **Block C2 infrastructure** at network level: all domains and IPs listed in IOC section
6. **Check for malicious .pth files** in Python site-packages directories

### Hardening
1. **Pin GitHub Actions to full commit SHA hashes** — never use version tags (this attack proves tags can be hijacked)
2. **Pin package versions explicitly** — disable auto-update in CI/CD
3. **Implement SLSA framework** for supply chain integrity verification
4. **Enable branch protection** with required reviews for all tag/release operations
5. **Use OIDC-based authentication** instead of long-lived PATs in CI/CD
6. **Disable automounting** of K8s service account tokens where not needed
7. **Monitor IMDS access** from unexpected processes; consider IMDSv2 enforcement on AWS
