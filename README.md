**Threat intelligence that works for you.**

---

Actioner lives in your Discord or Telegram. Ask it about a threat, or let it watch RSS feeds on its own. Either way, you get a researched report and detection rules that actually compile. Everything is configurable through chat: add feeds, change your briefing time, connect new channels, all just by asking.

*Built because I know I'm not getting up at midnight to write detections for a supply chain vuln.*

## See It Work

```
You: Research Scattered Spider's latest campaign

Actioner: On it — spinning up a research thread.

  [Thread: Research: Scattered Spider]
  Searching primary sources...
  Extracting IOCs — 12 IPs, 8 domains, 3 hashes
  Mapping TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK
  Generating Sigma rules — validating with sigma-cli
  Generating YARA rules — validating with yarac

  Report ready. [attached: scattered-spider-2026-04-03.md]

You: Are any of them on FBI most wanted?
Actioner (chat): Good question, yes, several members have been
  indicted. Added to research requirements.

You: Also focus on their SIM swapping TTPs
Actioner (chat): Added to requirements. The research agent will
  cover this before delivering the report.

Actioner (research): Updated report. All requirements satisfied.

```

## Get Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasPark20/Aegis.git
cd Aegis
claude
/setup
```

Setup walks you through everything: dependencies, Docker, API credentials, Discord/Telegram bot creation, and feed configuration.

## What Happens Next

Once it's running, you have four workflows. **Research on demand**: message Actioner about any threat and get a full report with IOCs, MITRE mappings, and validated detection rules. While research runs in the background, a fast chat agent handles your follow-ups in seconds. Every follow-up becomes a mandatory requirement the report must satisfy before delivery.

**Automated monitoring**: 11 RSS feeds are scanned every 2 hours. Critical items (zero-days, active exploitation, CISA advisories) get their own research thread immediately. Everything else compiles into a daily executive briefing delivered at your configured time.

## Prerequisites

Git, Node.js 22+, Docker, [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and an Anthropic API key or Claude Pro/Max subscription. Full setup guide in the [docs](https://thomaspark20.github.io/Aegis/guide/prerequisites).
